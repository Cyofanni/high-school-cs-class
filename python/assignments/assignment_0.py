#1. generate this list, using list comprehension:
#   fracts = [1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5 ..., 1023/1024];


#2. generate this list, using list comprehension:
#   fract_diffs = [fracts[1] - fracts[0], fracts[2] - fracts[1], fracts[3] - fracts[2] etc...]
#   where fracts has been built at point 1;


#3. generate a list containing Lucas numbers;

#4. use filter to extract the odd numbers out of a list of integers;

#5. use filter to extract powers of 2 out of a list of integers;
