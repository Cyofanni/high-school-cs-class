- Suppose that Bob wants to send Alice a message encrypted with the RSA cryptosystem.

- Alice must generate her pair (KEY_PUBLIC_ALICE, KEY_PRIVATE_ALICE):
    - Alice chooses two prime numbers (let the numbers be small in this example):
          p = 11, q = 17
      Generating prime numbers is easy.

    - Alice computes:
          n = p * q = 11 * 17 = 187
      Computing products is easy.

    - Alice computes:
          phi(n) = phi(p * q) = phi(p) * phi(q) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) =
          = 10 * 16 = 160
      Computing phi(n) is easy, if n's factors are known. Obviously, Alice knows
      p and q, the factors of n.

    - Alice finds an integer 'e' such that:
          gcd(e, phi(n)) = 1
      Alice chooses e = 7. In fact, gcd(e, phi(n)) = gcd(7, 160) = 1.
      This is easy.
    
    - Alice finds the modular inverse of e (modulo phi(n)), that is the integer 'd' such that:
          (e * d) mod phi(n) = 1
      d = 23, because (7 * 23) % 160 = 1.
      This is easy for Alice, because she knows phi(n).

    - Alice publishes:
          K_PUBLIC_ALICE: (e, n)
      This is Alice's RSA public key.

    - Alice keeps this secret:
          K_PRIVATE_ALICE: (d, n).
      This is Alice's RSA private key.

- Suppose that Bob wants to send a message 'P' encoded as the decimal number 149.
    - Bob encrypts P this way:
        E(P): (P ^ e) mod n = (149 ^ 7) % 187 = 140
        Bob sends the message 140 to Alice. Let's call 140 'C'.
      Notice that Bob encrypts P by means of e and n, which make up Alice's public key.
    
    - Alice receives 140, the ciphertext computed by Bob. She decrypts it this way:
        D(C): (C ^ d) mod n = (140 ^ 23) % 187 = 149. The result is exactly the Bob's plaintext!
        Notice that Alice made this computation using the parameters d and n, which make up her
        private key.

- The security of this cryptosystem is based on the fact that computing phi(n)
  is difficult for large n's, without knowing p and q, the prime factors of n.
